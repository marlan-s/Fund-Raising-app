# Fund-Raising-app
# 🎯 Intern Fundraising Dashboard App (Flutter)

A clean and responsive Flutter mobile app simulating a fundraising intern portal. This app showcases a basic UI flow for interns to track donations, check their referral code, view rewards, and keep up with announcements — all using **mock/dummy data**.

> 🚫 No backend or authentication is connected — this project is purely UI-focused.
